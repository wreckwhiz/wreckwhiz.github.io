	  <h1>Veganism </h1>
	  <h2> go Vegan</h2>
      <h3> Healthy Eating</h3>
      <p> Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.
There are many ways to embrace vegan living. Yet one thing all vegans have in common is a plant-based diet avoiding all animal foods such as meat (including fish, shellfish and insects), dairy, eggs and honey - as well as products like leather and any tested on animals. </p>

      <h3>keeping active </h3>
      <p> So you’ve decided that you’d like to become vegan, but where do you start? Transitioning to a vegan lifestyle can seem really daunting but often the idea of a big lifestyle change is a lot scarier than actually doing it. If you focus on making one change at a time the progression to veganism will feel quite natural. It’s important to go at your own pace and to decide on a method that works best for you. Here are some ideas and guidelines to structure your transition to veganism, just be sure to tailor them to your specific needs.</p>

        <h2> get involved</h2>
      <h3> make the change</h3>
      <p>A vegan diet is one that consists of only plant-derived foods. Vegans don’t use or consume any animals or animal products including flesh (land or sea animals), milk, eggs, or honey. <br>

	Eating vegan is affordable. The most nutritious and inexpensive vegan foods which can be found in any supermarket, are fresh produce, grains, legumes and nuts and seeds. These should make up the bulk of the diet for optimum health. There are more and more options of vegan processed foods such as soy hot dogs, vegan “cheeses,” desserts, which make transitioning to a vegan diet easy and fun!</p>

        <h3> Detox green juice</h3>
        <p>  helps with fat loss in a number of ways. Weight training itself burns calories. Studies also show that, unlike aerobic exercise, weight training increases the calories you burn at rest for up to 39 hours after your workout.</p>

        <h3> Banana Milk </h3>
        <p> No gym? No problem. A circuit alternating jump rope and strength training is the perfect low-cost way to shred on the cheap!</p>
        
        <img src="images/exercises_drink.png" />
        <h3>Glowing skin smoothie</h3>
        <p> The best bet for rehydration is to consume a low-cal beverage that contains electrolytes such as sodium and potassium. Good choices include sports drinks (go low-cal if your workout), try coconut water, or water with a slice of fruit. The refreshing hint of flavor may drive you to drink more.</p>
